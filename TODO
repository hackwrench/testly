Legend:
[ ] not done
[+] in progess
[X] done!

### Implementation
[+] Simple example about using Testly
  [ ] Add more documentation about use of the library
[X] Reduced interface in lib/testly.bi

### Internals
[X] Linked List
  [X] TestCases in Suite
  [X] Suites Collection
[X] Structure
  [X] Suite (simple basic information about the suite)
  [X] Test (the same applies to the test
  [X] Assertion
  [X] Helpers that register and add test to each suite
[+] Helpers
  [X] Context used to reference current Suite and Test (CURRENT_* ptr)
  [+] defines for fast access (without using namespace)
    [+] more defines about kind of assertions
  [X] Enhance output and report of failures
  [X] Correct assertion logging (FailureLog)

### Self-Testing
[X] Eat our own food!
  [X] mechanism to exclude a suite from the results (useful to test failed suites)
  [X] create internal helpers to access count and information about suites, tests and results.
  [X] Perform testing
    [X] Based on TESTMAP
      [X] Evaluate if Suites and Tests are defined and could be selected (select_*)
      [X] Evaluate if the names of the fixture suites match
      [X] Evaluate if the fixture suites pass both setup and teardown process.
      [X] Evaluate failures and errors counts due setup and teardown failures.
      [X] Evaluate number of assertions performed in each fixture suite and compare them
      [X] Evaluate the success or failure of the test that comprises each suite in the fixture.
      [X] Evaluate the quantity of tests of each suite.
      [X] Evaluate if assertions inside setup/teardown work without glitches.
    [X] Functional Testing
      [X] Test Internal Linked List works.
      [X] Test if helpers do what is supposed to do.
